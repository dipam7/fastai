# fastai

This is a repository of all the projects I've worked on while doing the [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) courses.
The courses are incredibly good, and I would recommend them to everyone regardless of their background.

## [1. Practical deep learning for coders v3](https://github.com/dipam7/fastai/tree/master/deep_learning/course1)

Find the detailed explanations for the projects in the READMEs of the respective folders or [on my blog](https://medium.com/@dipam44)
