# [Multi-label classification](https://github.com/dipam7/fastai/blob/master/deep_learning/course1/lesson3/multi-label-classification-using-fastai.ipynb)

In this project, we try to predict the multiple labels associated with satellite images. This is important for tracking
human activities in large regions of the Earth, and conserving bio diversity. Check out [my article](https://medium.com/@dipam44/multi-label-classification-using-fastai-e424d7e71dcc) on the same.

# [Image segmentation](https://github.com/dipam7/fastai/blob/master/deep_learning/course1/lesson3/image-segmentation-using-fastai.ipynb)

Image segmentation is an application of computer vision where in we color code every pixel in an image. Each pixel then represents a particular object in that image. Learn more about the same in my article [here](https://medium.com/code-heroku/image-segmentation-with-fastai-9f8883cc5b53).

Image segmentation has a lot of significance in the field of medicine. Parts that need to be studied are color coded and viewed in scans taken from different angles. They are then used for things like automatic measurement of organs, cell counting, or simulations based on the extracted boundary information.

# [Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews using Language Model](https://github.com/dipam7/fastai/blob/master/deep_learning/course1/lesson3/transfer-learning-in-nlp-using-fastai.ipynb)

Traditional approaches to sentiment analysis, ones that used n-grams sometimes worked well. However, these approaches did not understand English and therefore failed. In this notebook we use a language model and transfer the encoding knowledge to our model to help it understand English.
