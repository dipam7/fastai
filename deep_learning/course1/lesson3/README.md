# [Multi-label classification](https://github.com/dipam7/fastai/blob/master/deep_learning/course1/lesson3/multi-label-classification-using-fastai.ipynb)

In this project, we try to predict the multiple labels associated with satellite images. This is important for tracking
human activities in large regions of the Earth, and conserving bio diversity. Check out [my article](https://medium.com/@dipam44/multi-label-classification-using-fastai-e424d7e71dcc) on the same.
