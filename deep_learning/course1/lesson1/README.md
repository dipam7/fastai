# [Intel scene classification challenge](https://github.com/dipam7/fastai/blob/master/deep_learning/course1/lesson1/intel-scene-classification-challenge.ipynb)

This project was part of an [online hackathon](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-intel-scene-classification-challe/) I participated in! As of writing this README.md I was in the top 2% in the hackathon.
Rank: 37 out of 2276. Check out my [article](https://medium.com/@dipam44/my-first-deep-learning-hackathon-d98b20c5afc7) on the same.

# [Pneumonia detection](https://github.com/dipam7/fastai/blob/master/deep_learning/course1/lesson1/pneumonia_detection.ipynb)

This is an image classification project with the goal of predicting whether a given X-ray has pneumonia or not.
